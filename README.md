# Useless-troll-program
Wanna cause some pain in the ass to your teachers?
This program is like the cat command, except it prints everything uppercase
that wouldn't be much of a problem.
It's hard to read, cause it uses the GNU compiler macros to initialise values.
Just an useless piece of software but can cause problems when reading.
